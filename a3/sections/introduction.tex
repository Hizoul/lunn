\section{Introduction}
% neural networks paper f√ºr kurs
This paper is the result of fulfilling assignment 3 of the neural networks course in the university of Leiden.
It asks the students to portray a freely chosen research topic within the field of neural networks.
We chose to bring the topic of \textit{deep dreaming} closer to the reader.

% was machen wir eigentlich
Deep Dreaming enables the visualization of known features of a trained neural network.
Section \ref{sec:problem-statement} will inform why this was invented and how it is useful.
Section \ref{sec:previous-work} will then look at what similar things were done before the idea of \textit{deep dreaming}.
We then will go deep into the inner workings of the algorithm itself in Section \ref{sec:how} to explain why the visualization works.
We will use hand picked images and models, detailed in Section \ref{sec:data} to apply deep dreaming to. The results of these experiments will be displayed in Section \ref{sec:evaluation}, and possible conclusions drawn in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.
