\section{Introduction}
% neural networks paper f√ºr kurs
This paper is the result of fulfilling assignment 3 of the neural networks course at the Universiteit Leiden.
The assignment demands to portray a research topic within the field of neural networks.
We chose to experiment with the visualization of the learned \enquote{knowledge} of a network though \emph{Deep Dream}.

Section \ref{sec:problem-statement} will explain the problems with the lack of knowledge about the encoded data of the trained weights of a neural network.
In section \ref{sec:previous-work} we will look at related work and possible applications.
After that we go deep into the inner workings of the algorithm Deep Dream itself in section \ref{sec:how} to explain how the dreaming works.
We will use and present hand picked images and models, detailed in section \ref{sec:data} to conduct our experiments with. 
The results of these experiments will be displayed in section \ref{sec:evaluation}, and possible conclusions drawn in section \ref{sec:conclusion}.
