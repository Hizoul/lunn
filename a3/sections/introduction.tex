\section{Introduction}
This paper is the result of fulfilling assignment 3 of the neural networks course at the Universiteit Leiden.
The assignment demands to portray a research topic within the field of neural networks.
We chose to experiment with the visualization of the learned \enquote{knowledge} of a network through \emph{Deep Dream}.

Section \ref{sec:problem-statement} will explain the problems with the lack of knowledge about the encoded data of the trained weights of a neural network.
In section \ref{sec:previous-work} a look at related work and possible applications is taken.
After that the inner workings of the algorithm \textit{Deep Dream} itself are explained in section \ref{sec:how}.
We will use and present hand picked images and a model, detailed in section \ref{sec:data} to conduct our experiments with.
The results of these experiments will be displayed in section \ref{sec:evaluation} and possible conclusions drawn in section \ref{sec:conclusion}.
