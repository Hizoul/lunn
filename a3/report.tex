\section*{Abstract}
Neural networks pose a big black box that limits development to trial and error in a certain degree.
\emph{Deep Dream} offers one possibility to look into convolutional neural networks.
Moreover it offers unique visually pleasant results.

By using the \emph{Caffe} framework we were able to visualize learned features of the famous \emph{Residual Network} developed by Microsoft Research.
In the process of dreaming a multitude of features ranging from abstract textures to high level objects were discovered.
To granularly control the features drawn, one can create a \emph{guided dream}, where features of a reference image are replicated onto another.
Furthermore applying a \emph{bilateral} filter can also change the features drawn by a dream.
